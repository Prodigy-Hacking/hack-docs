## Features
{:.mt-lg-0}

Despite being a mediocre theme, we've got a features that we're especially proud of and dedicate a lot of our time to making sure they work as expected.

### Graceful Degradation

This theme uses as little JavaScript as possible. All of our anchors and table of contents are generated at build time. Any features that rely on JavaScript have fallbacks for graceful degradation. It's how the web should be nowadays.

### Heavily Customizable

A lot of parts in these theme consist of empty Jekyll includes that are designed to be overridden by website owners. Inject your custom code easily to any part of the website!

### Dark Mode

We all know that dark mode makes you a better human. This theme supports a dark mode based on each user's preference.
